                    <p>A word is worth one sela', and silence is worth two.<a href="#r1">[1]</a> When speaking one's mind, major discretion is required, as to not confuse the listener, or overflow them with unnecessary information.</p>

                    <p>To call myself esoteric would be an understatement. My life is akin that of Kabbalah. Interesting, no doubt, but often very confusing and precise.</p>

                    <p>When I'm not studying mysticism and religion, I'm practicing it. I'm also known to be a prolific yapper, a big listener of music, and the #1 fan of Touhou Project. My favorite character is Cirno, the smartest and strongest character in the franchise, and totally not a baka.<sup><a style="font-style: italic;font-size:10px;">[citation needed]</a></sup></p>

                    <p>I've once again resurrected my website, since I want to get back into writing and programming again after a very long break. In the time that I've spent off the screen, I've changed quite a bit. My interests have shifted, my behavior has evolved, and things seem to make a bit more sense now.</p>

                    <p>Obviously, I'm still working hard on my website and on myself, so bear with me as I figure all of this stuff out. Below you can find a list of my writings. Some people call them blog posts, but I feel like that's too fancy for them. They're writings, just like what you'd find on the back of a cereal box, but even less comprehensible.</p>
