Same goes for owning a 1962 missal and believing in the Pope. That's not heretical, it's Catholic. Sedevacantism is weird and heretical, and honestly doesn't even make sense. Get offline, get on the Gospels. ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡¦</marquee>

                    <p>Hello, everyone! I return once again as Ezra<sup><a style="font-style: italic;font-size:10px;" href="#r1">[1]</a></sup>, and this is my whimsical and wondrous website. My favorite things are religion, writing, programming, and video games.</p>

                    <p>I'm a <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church">Roman Catholic</a>, and I very deeply value the teachings of Christ. I believe in equal rights for all people, poverty, chastity, obedience, humility, and the most important commandment of all: love.</p>

                    <p>It should also be noted that, while I enjoy attending a Latin Mass here and there, and I do adore the 1962 Roman missal, I do not consider myself to be a traditional Catholic, or "tradcat," nor "radtrad" either. I am just a Catholic, because that's what matters, not politics. Do not interact with me if you're going to deny Vatican II or climate change, just read the Bible.</p>

                        width="45%" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;filter:grayscale(100%);" />

                    </div>

                    <p>I've once again resurrected my website, since I want to get back into writing and programming again after a very long break. In the time that I've spent off the screen, I've changed quite a bit. My interests have shifted, my behavior has evolved, and things seem to make a bit more sense now.</p>

                    <p>Obviously, I'm still working hard on my website and on myself, so bear with me as I figure all of this stuff out. Below you can find a list of my writings. Some people call them blog posts, but I feel like that's too fancy for them. They're writings, just like what you'd find on the back of a cereal box, but even less comprehensible.</p>
