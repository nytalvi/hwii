                        <p>Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us concerning the washing of the hands.</p>
                        <p>Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has formed man in wisdom, and created within him numerous orifices and cavities. It is revealed and known before the Throne of Your Glory that if but one of them were to be blocked, or one of them were to be open, it would be impossible to exist even for a short while. Blessed are You, Lord, who heals all flesh and performs wonders.</p>
                        <p>My God, the soul which You have given within me is pure. You have created it, You have formed it, You have breathed it into me, and You preserve it within me. You will eventually take it from me, and restore itt within me in the Time to Come. So long as the soul is within me, I offer thanks to You, Lord my God and God of my fathers, Master of all works, Lord of all souls. Blessed are You, Lord, who restores souls to dead bodies.</p>
