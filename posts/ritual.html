                    <h2>The Ritual</h2>
                    <p>People create everyday. I've heard that, specifically in Judaism, the Sabbath is given to us as a break from creating, just as God took a break from creating. I don't create worlds, but I do create writings, songs, drawings, memories...</p>

                    <p>I've started writing a lot more recently, but it poses the question: for whom?</p>

                    <p>I can't depend on anyone to read my things, and I don't have to. Writing is like a silent ritual, between myself and the divine, and infinitely meaningful no matter how many eyes it reaches.<sup><a style="font-style: italic;font-size:10px;" href="#r1">[1]</a></sup></p>

                    <p>It is personally satisfying to me to complete a paper and publish it on my website, knowing that I made something real. So that's why I enjoy writing, and will continue to do so as long as I can.</p>

                        <li id="r1">In Ancient Egypt, priests would do offerings where they'd present food, incense, etc. to their deities, and many would do it as a daily ritual. The priests would then eat them, which symbolized a communion between the divine and mortal. In Hinduism, the practice of <i>puja</i> is similar, where devotees would offer food, flowers, and prayers to their deities. These rituals were often performed at home.</li>
